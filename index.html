            <h2>The Netherlands</h2>
            <p>
               My eldest sister, Stephanie, has lived near Amsterdam for the past 20+ years. I would like to visit her
               in the place she has called home for so long. We'd take the oppoutunity to visit national parks, beaches.
               Definitely visit local restaurants since I love trying new foods.

            <h2>Venice, Italy</h2>
            <p>
               I learned about Venice when I was in middle school and I loved the idea of being able to travel there
               one day. I'd like to be able to ride a gondola in the canals, try the local food and visit their
               museums.

            <h2>Japan</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               Since 2020 I've been loosely planning to travel to Japan one day. I've even started to learn japanese!
               I'm on a 565 day streak of learning every day. Awesome. There are many restaurants, amusement parks and onsen ryokans -
               a tradtional inn with hot springs! Safe to say I'll have plenty of things to do.
